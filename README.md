#Password-Generator

About The Project:

  I wanted to create an application that can be used to generate a random password based on user selected criteria.  Given completed HTML and CSS code with which to work, I added JavaScript code to run the password generator in the browser. The JavaScript I added allows one to enter preferred criteria and generate a strong, more secure password.  
  
  
  Built With:
  -HTML
  -CSS
  -JavaScript
  
  
  Installation:
  Clone the repo: https://github.com/pamelac21/Password-Generator.git


Usage:


  When the "Generate Password" button is clicked, the user should be presented with a series of prompts for password criteria. The first prompt is for a password length of 8 to 128 characters.  If they choose outside that range, they receive a message to choose from the given range.  If they do not enter a length for the password, they are alerted that it is a required value.  Next, they can select whether or not to include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers and/or symbols. If they do not choose one of the criteria, they are prompted that they must and receive a message to try again.  Once the user selects the required criteria, the program will print a random password using said criteria in the placeholder box in the center of the screen.
